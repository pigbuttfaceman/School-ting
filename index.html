		<p> Turtles are the tanks of the sea their hard shell can
	  withstand the force of a 4-ton nuclear bomb explosion. The bite of the turtle
	  is a devastating blow it can crack titanium with just a brush of its scaly lips.
	  The weight of a turtle can grow up to an astonishing 75,000 pounds. Did you know
	  that turtles can fly. If you're like me and are reading this for the first time
	  you are probably thinking what the heck I didn't know that turtles can fly. Yes,
	  turtles can fly they don't anymore because of predators such as the African
	  seagull or the Atlantic flying crab. So there now you know. Next week we learn
	  about frogs.</p>
